## About

The purpose of the activity is to
1). Increase your understanding of how various linked lists work
2). Give you the opportunity to implement a custom data structure

## Instructions

1). For each data structure,
    - Singly Linked List
    - Doubly Linked List
    - Circular Singly Linked List
    - Circular Doubly Linked List

    Create the add(), remove(), printAll(), and revPrintAll() (that last one is for cdll and dll only) methods.
    The test set up in ParentLL can tell you if your implementation is correct and complete.
